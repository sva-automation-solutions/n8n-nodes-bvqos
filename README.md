# n8n-nodes-bvqos
 
This node was developed for all BVQ users who want to take a step into the future and use BVQ as part of n8n integrations for unimaginable amounts of different workflows. This node is only aimed at the OS/Generic folder, but the possibilities are still endless. Want to try it out? Go ahead and download the node for your personal use.
 
[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) workflow automation platform.

## Credentials
 
To access this node, you only need to enter your username, password, and the URL of your BVQ instance. It's that simple! As mentioned above, we recommend not using a personal or high-level account, but rather one that was created specifically for use with n8n and does not contain sensitive information.
 
## Usage
 
This node uses the URL that you can find in the “Export” section of your BVQ interface. You decide what type of information you want to receive, and you'll get it in seconds in JSON format. This information can be used for anything you want to do within your workflow: automatic emails, performance analysis, value logging, and much more. Thanks to this node, everything that could previously be done with BVQ can now be done in a much easier and more efficient way.
